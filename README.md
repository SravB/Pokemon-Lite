Pokemon Lite Game Manual

Objective: 
To catch, train and evolve your pokemon to the highest level possible in order to beat Gary Oak in the final one on one pokemon battle. 

Pokemon Background Information: 

General Storyline
In the world of Pokemon, there are numerous monsters that roam the land with each possessing elemental abilities. Pokemon trainers catch these monsters and train them to battle other trainers in order to test their training abilities. In this simulation, you are Ash Ketchum who is destined to ‘be the very best, like no one ever was.’ In order to accomplish this goal, you must first beat your rival Gary Oak. Professor Oak, Gary’s grandfather, is Ash’s mentor and gifts him one of three random starting pokemon: Charmander, Squirtle or Bulbasaur. 

Basic Information & Evolution
Pokemon have various stats such as their level and based on this, they have a certain attack power, defense power, health points and speed. Pokemon also have the unique ability to evolve as they gain strength or level up. One species of pokemon can evolve into another upon reaching a certain level. For example, Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at level 16 and Ivysaur evolves into Venusaur at level 32. Each evolution vastly increases a pokemon’s stats. As mentioned previously, there are numerous species of pokemon that roam the land. However, in this simplified version, there are roughly 20 pokemon species, listed below. Also listed are each pokemon’s elemental type, evolution stage (where 0 represents the initial stage) and evolution level, the minimum level required in order to evolve to the next stage (where 0 signifies that the pokemon does not evolve any further). The information listed below serves as a database for all pokemon information and is commonly referred to as a pokedex.

Catching Pokemon
One way to grow your pokemon team is by catching pokemon. In your journey to ‘catch them all,’ you begin with 10 pokeballs which you can use to catch pokemon you encounter in the wild. The maximum size of your pokemon party is 6 so choose your pokemon wisely.

Type Advantages
There are also type advantages during battle. In this simplified recreation there are only 4 types to consider:

Fire, Water, Grass and Bug

Type Specialties, Training & Healing
Furthermore, in this simplified version, each pokemon has another unique ‘power’ quality which is based on their type. For example, fire type pokemon have a field called fire power and this convention is also used for the other 3 types. These type specific powers are used during training to increase certain stats of a pokemon. Each type has a specific quality that is associated for that type such as fire types being associated with higher attack powers. 

The higher the type specific power than the more the associated quality will increase during a single training session. For example, by training a fire type pokemon, the pokemon’s attack power will increase by a certain proportion of its fire power. However, training does reduce a pokemon’s health by half of their max health. In order to retrain a pokemon, they must be healed by using potions. In this game, you start with 15 potions but you cannot obtain any more so use them cautiously. 

Breeding
Pokemon can also breed which will create a level 1 infant pokemon at the lowest evolutionary stage of one of the two parent pokemon.

Evolution Stones
The generous Professor Oak not only gifts you a starter pokemon but also a random evolution stone but not necessarily of the same type as your starter. There are 3 types of evolution stones: a fire stone, water stone and leaf stone. Each stone can evolve a pokemon of their respective type but they can only be used once.


In Game Options

You will first be greeted by a starting screen followed by a list of options to chose from. The following section explains all the possible actions to chose from and what they do. 



1 - Battle
Input “1” once your pokemon has trained to your desired level and evolved to your desired evolutionary stage to put your pokemon to the test against Gary Oak and attempt to win the final battle. You only get one chance so make sure you are well prepared.


2 - Train
Input “2” to train a pokemon of your choice in order to increase their stats and potentially level up. Training will decrease the pokemon’s hp by half of their max health and if the pokemon does not have enough health they will not be able to train.


3 - Heal
Input “3” to heal a pokemon of your choice to full HP in order to continue training or begin battle. A potion is necessary in order to heal your pokemon, but your collection of potions are limited so be careful! 


4 - Catch pokemon 
Input “4” to be given a random pokemon and a random level with an option to catch or run. Input “1” to take your chances in potentially catching a new pokemon and adding it to your collection or “2” to abandon and go back to the home screen. 


5 - Breed
Input “5” to breed two pokemon from your list of owned pokemon followed by the numbers that correspond with the pokemon you wish to breed. There is a 50% of breeding either pokemon type. 


6 - Use evolution stone 
Input “6” to use an evolution stone to evolve one of your pokemon. Make sure to match the same type stone to your pokemon, for example, a Leaf Stone to a grass type pokemon. 


7 - Check Stats 
Input “7” to check the statistics of all your pokemon. This includes HP, attack power, defense power, speed and their special power. 

Description: 
    Pokemon Lite is a simplified recreation of the Nintendo classic, Pokemon Red. It allows the player to interact with their pokemon by training, evolving, catching or breeding with other pokemon. You begin with one of three starter pokemon: Charmander, Squirtle or Bulbasaur. You must expand and train your pokemon team in this adventure. The main objective is to triumph in the final battle against your lifelong rival, Gary Oak and his cherished Blastoise. 

Features:
Pokedex - each pokemon has a field which stores a list of pokemon with proper types and levels (essentially a database of pokemon information also known as a pokedex)  
Train - train your pokemon to level up and, eventually, evolve to a higher evolutionary stage
Breed -  use two pokemon to breed a third pokemon of equal chance of being the species of the first or second pokemon
Heal - refill health points after training pokemon in order to continue training and prepare for battle 
Level Up - levels the user’s pokemon after meeting certain criteria based on training. This method can only be called through the train method and not on its own
Evolve - allows the user to evolve their pokemon to a stronger evolutionary stage. The player must own the proper stone type to match pokemon type.
Battle - the user chooses a pokemon to battle Gary, the boss pokemon, based on the pokemon’s statistics. The user only gets one chance, otherwise they must restart the game
Miss Chance - during the battle there is also a chance that a pokemon will miss their move 
Type Advantages - during battle some types are ‘super effective’ or ‘not very effective’ against others and our program detects this and informs the user of their superior or inferior move
Pokemon with Specific Types (Fire, Water, Bug and Grass types)
Special Power - each has a type-specific special power (fire power, water power, grass power, bug power) and specific statistics associated with each type
Catch Pokemon - gives the user the option to venture into the wild in order to expand their pokemon collection
Evolution Stones - allows the user to use their type-specific evolutionary stone on a pokemon
Display Stats - displays the stats of the user’s pokemon team to allow the user to make informed decisions
‘Sleep’ Printing - during the battle sequence against Gary, the program prints one word at a time in order to recreate this nostalgic feature of the original game
